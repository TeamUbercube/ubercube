Ubercube is a first person shooter multi-player game set in a completely destroyable voxel world.
The map can be procedurally generated or pre-made.

The game is in development, for more information on it we have french updates and more info on the [#Ubercube](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ubercube?src=hash) and on the [Ubercube](https://twitter.com/UbercubeGame) twitter account.

## How to play ?
For the moment the only way to play Ubercube is to compile the game yourself.

We de not want to have an unfinished version to be downloadable, so we will provide the launcher once pre-alpha 1.1 is out.


## How to compiling ?

Clone master's branch (to compile the official ubercue release) on your computer:
> git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/TeamUbercube/ubercube.git

Or download the archive on [here](https://github.com/TeamUbercube/ubercube/archive/master.zip).

Compile or run sources with your own IDE (**don't forget** to setup dependencies and natives).

And run **both server and client**.

#### Client :

> java -jar ubercube_client.jar *< ip >:< port > < username >*

#### Server :

> java -jar ubercube_server.jar *< port >*
